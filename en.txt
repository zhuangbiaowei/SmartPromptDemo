Every year, the Catholic Church joins in prayer and action to mark the
World Day of Migrants and Refugees. This year’s theme is “God Walks
with His People,” so the Jesuit Migration Network has created a
campaign that invites you to walk with nine people as they tell their
stories of migration, or working with migrants. 

Over the course of six audio reflections, we invite you to join migrants
in solidarity and prayer. Whether you listen by yourself on your
morning walk or in community, we have resources to deepen your
reflection and help you commit to stand with migrants all year long.
